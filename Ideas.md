---- Main ideas ---- 

1. Focus on medical dataset 
2. Focus model (use well-known dataset)


--- Other ideas ---
- Use techniques based on Random Occlusion (eg. cut-out)
    - Used to avoid overfitting 
- Use techniques based on Deep Learning 


--- Focus points --- 

- Overfitting / underfitting 
- Oversampling / undersampling 
- Test time augmentations / Train time augmentations
