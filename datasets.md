TODO: 
1. Understand different YOLO methods, and choose a first try out version.. 
        - GUIDE: https://blog.paperspace.com/train-yolov7-custom-data/ 
2. Understand GAN methods, and choose a version we would like to try 
3. Choose some standard methods and try out (we can always add more and more)
