# 1. meeting: 05/03/2024
- Present our idea: 
    * We want to work with medical data 
    * Often seen that 70/30 for accordingly sick/healty --> augmentation to produce healty images
    * For the model construction we think something like cycle GAN for aug, then use YOLO... 
- Questions: 
    1. How much "new work" do we need, and how much can we get inspiration from others? 

- Notes:
- select 2 or more papers (related work - not in high detail, how data aug is used)
- resulst : show how they works... 
- take reulst and compare - which are faster wich most impact 
- different approaches (and prioritixe)
- aug in input and in train 
- experiments: varience..... 
- find mathemical explanations 
- this aug works for small models but not for big ones... 
- yolo!  (check papers)
- if std approach choose different types 
- could compare with e.g cycleGAN 
- COCO dataset (80 object categories)


# 2. meeting: 19/03/2024

Questions: 
- The method of testing many methods on the same model and see the variance and mean in between ?? 

- Dataset: Should we use the entire coco dataset or would it make sense for us to only use a subset, to see the change with data augmentation? (Which way to view the problem?)
- YOLO: If we want to do data augmentation on the training data, and we now have used the yolo model, you have given, is this then possible? Can we change the weights?? 
- We are mainly using the code you have provided, is this okay? We think our task is the comparison part... 
- Are there any guidlines for the length of the report? 


Notes:

- Training, check darknet, use higher levels of yolo, https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7
    - pretrained models, 
    - small models, firstly
    - yolo code, first download model, accuracy is the same. Further train it, first with pictures, and then after with our data augmentation.
    - measure? model same, inference speed would be the same. Different methods would take more or less time. 
    - train on hole data set(coco), same procedure is correct. 
        - randomness
        - downlaod already trained model
        - retrain the model and confirm accuracy. 
        - train with the same procedure

        - start experiment, remove data augmentation from the original
        - then we should use different methods, one by one or more together, and train. (aplecation study)
        - see results

        - next step, reduce coco(subset)
        - see what we can do with data augmentation, and see which methods works best. 

- metoder, kig p√• hvilke der er brugt meget nu her. 


        
- Data augmentation, during trainnig. Use it for test, he dont think so
- GPU, brightspace see tutorial

# 3. meeting: 09/04/2024
Questions: 
- We have found out to remove data augmentation. Can we use their implementations to handle the experiments (with support from other articles why we use these particular ones)
    - Or do our project needs us to implement anything ourselves?

- We are thinking to divide it into two different experiments. 
    1. Test whole dataset validate with their results and test individual traditional data augemntations (all 3 categories)
    2. Make subset and make test of org. data for comparison and use CycleGen datasets of syntehtic dataset. Maybe also compare with some traditional data augemntations.
